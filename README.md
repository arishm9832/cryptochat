Cryptochat – Decentralized Web3 Social Media
Cryptochat is a decentralized social media platform built on Ethereum, where your profile and posts are NFTs. Users can create a unique NFT profile, share posts (with text and images) as NFTs, and tip others’ content with ETH. The feed is fully on-chain, censorship-resistant, and rewards valuable contributions.

🚀 Features
NFT Profiles: Mint your own avatar and username as an NFT.

Post as NFT: Share text and images; each post is stored as an NFT on IPFS.

Tipping: Tip other users’ posts with ETH, incentivizing quality content.

Dynamic Feed: Posts with the most tips appear at the top.

MetaMask Integration: Connect your wallet to manage your profile and interact with the dApp.

IPFS Storage: All media and metadata are stored on decentralized storage.

Real-Time Updates: See new posts and tips instantly.
